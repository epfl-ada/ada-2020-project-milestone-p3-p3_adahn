### Title : Where does the racial disparities come from in police stops ?

### Abstract :
As the paper looked for bias in stop decisions across the United States and the effect of marijuana legalization on top decisions, we wanted to also look first whether the race of the officer has also an effect on race bias in stop decisions. Then, we want to also include subject's sex in the study by looking whether there's a bias in driver's sex and race in stop decisions. Then, we want to go deeper in the search by really assessing the paper's question which is the analysis of racial disparities in police stops. We want to look whether the percentage of race arrest is correlating with the race percentage from counties or if there's really a bias in stops. Finally, we want to look at the effect of politics in racial disparities for police stops. Effectively we want to take states that are majoritary Democratic or Republicans and see if the politics influences racial disparities in police stops.

### Research questions : 
What is the effect of officer's race on racial diparities in police stops ?
Is the racial disparity in police stops equal across subject's sex ?
Is the racial disparity due to different race percentages in counties ?
Does the politics influence race disparities in police stops ?

### Proposed datasets : 
1) Stanford Open Policing Project (paper based dataset) : https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/ 
2) Wikipedia for race percentages of counties and politics majorites in states

### Methods :
We will first extract from the whole dataset driver's race and officer's race to analyze if it has an effect on racial disparities. Then we will do the same but this time with subject's sex. Then we would have to get a dataset from Wikipedia with the race percentages in counties that have data for police stops. We would then normalize race stops to this percentages and see if there is still an effect of racial disparity or if the effect is even bigger. Finally, we will get a dataset from Wikipedia but this time with the majority of politics of different states. We will not use Swing States but only States majoritary Democrates or Republicans. We will thus see if there is a correlation between state's politic and racial disparity in police stops.

### Proposed timeline :
As we will have around 3 weeks to work on this extension of the study, we will start by answering the two first questions during the first week. The second week, we will get Wikipedia's datatset and during the third week analyze the datatset to answer the two other questions.
